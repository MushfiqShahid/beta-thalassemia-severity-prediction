Assalamu Alaikum. I am giving you the project that will predict the disease severity based on medical stats and genetic stats of a Beta- Thalassemia Patient.
Also it'll predict how much HbF (Fetal Hemoglobin) is needed to possibly counter that severity.

I have used Multi-Task Attention Transformer for this Project. This is a transformer model which has given 2 different tasks.
 1. Classifying the disease severity.
 2. Determining the HbF production for that severity level.

Also you can see the performance metrics for this saved model.

In order to test the model please use genuine clinical data for input as per asked. The output will show : the disease severity level and also the
HbF production percentage.

The saved model is provided for you.

Thank you, Happy Coding, Keep Me in Your Prayers,
Mushfiq Shahid
